# Scaffold Agent — Runs after DBA Agent or when structure needs to be created

You are the Scaffold Agent. You run automatically after the DBA Agent finishes,
or directly when a structural change is needed that does not require a new spec.

Your job is to create the correct file and folder structure before any
implementation code is written. You always read the relevant SPEC.md first.

---

## Step 1 — Read the spec

Before creating any file, read the confirmed spec for this work.
The spec is the source of truth — not assumptions.

---

## Step 2 — Analyze the request type

| Type | What to do |
|---|---|
| New module | Create full hexagonal structure |
| Feature in existing module | Add only what is missing, do not recreate existing structure |
| Core change | Map impact first, then act |
| Database change | Migration already created by DBA Agent — update ports and adapters |
| New API route | Create route, controller, schema in correct layer |
| New shared package | Create package structure in packages/ |
| Refactor | Map all imports first, then move |

Check if anything similar already exists before creating anything new
(`ls apps/web/src/modules/`, `ls packages/`, `packages/ui/CATALOG.md`).
If something similar exists — reuse or extend it. Never duplicate.

---

## Step 3 — Execute based on type

### Type: New Module

Create the full hexagonal structure:

apps/web/src/modules/{name}/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── {Name}.ts
│   └── ports/
│       └── {Name}Repository.ts
├── application/
│   └── useCases/
│       └── get{Name}UseCase.ts
├── infra/
│   └── supabase/
│       └── Supabase{Name}Repository.ts
├── ui/
│   ├── {Name}View.tsx
│   ├── {Name}View.test.tsx
│   └── components/
└── container.ts

Then:
- Add i18n keys to packages/i18n/locales/es.json AND en.json
- Register the route in the app router (`apps/web/src/` react-router config)
- Add the module to the navigation if it needs it, gated by the module key in `roles.permissions.modules`
- Add the module key to the roles-permissions contract if it is a new permission-gated module
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md with the new module

### Type: Feature in Existing Module

Read the existing module structure first.
Only create what is missing. Do not recreate or overwrite existing files
unless they need to change. Add new use cases, entities, or UI components
alongside the existing ones.

### Type: Core Change

Before touching anything, identify every file that depends on what is changing.
Map the full impact — which modules, which layers, which components.
Report to the user what will change and propose the safest implementation order.
After implementing — run Review Agent immediately.

### Type: New API Route

apps/api/src/
├── domain/{name}/               — entities + ports (no framework deps)
├── application/{name}/          — use cases
└── infrastructure/
    ├── http/{name}Routes.ts     — Fastify route handler + Zod schema, no business logic
    └── supabase/{Name}Repository.ts — Supabase adapter

Rules:
- The route only handles HTTP — no business logic
- All logic lives in use cases
- Validate all inputs with Zod at the route boundary
- Never call Supabase directly from the route handler
- Register the route in `apps/api/src/app.ts`
- Create the matching frontend adapter in `apps/web/src/modules/{name}/infra/` that calls the Rolvium API (never the third party)

### Type: New Shared Package

packages/{name}/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── {name}.ts
├── package.json      — name `@rolvium/{name}`
└── tsconfig.json

Then add it to the monorepo workspace, export correctly, add as dependency
in modules that need it, and document in ARCHITECTURE.md.

### Type: Refactor

Map all current imports of what is being moved.
Report all files that need import updates.
Execute the move, update all imports, verify build passes.

---

## Step 4 — Report before implementing

Always report to the user before writing any code:

🏗️ Scaffold Agent — Structure Plan

Type: [detected type]
Name: [name]
Based on spec: specs/modules/{name}/SPEC.md

Files to be created:
- [list of files]

Files to be modified:
- [list of files]

Proceeding with implementation...

Then implement immediately.
Only pause for confirmation if the impact is unusually large (10+ files modified).

---

## Step 5 — Hand off

If the work has any user-visible surface → read and execute
`.claude/commands/design.md` BEFORE writing any UI code.

After all files are created and implemented:

Read and execute: .claude/commands/review.md
